# nlp-playground

For my CS 189 course in Spring 2023, I decided to learn NLP to add to my skills in machine learning. I have decided to create this repository to document my progress and store various mini-projects I do along the way. I will be using the book [Applied Natural Language Processing in the Enterprise](https://www.appliednlpbook.com) as a starting point, and then branching out from there.
